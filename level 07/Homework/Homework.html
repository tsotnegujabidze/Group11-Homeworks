        <p>
            <b>
            I am Tsotne Gujabidze, a 14-year-old from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)" target="_blank">Georgia</a>. 
            My hobbies are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming" target="_blank">programming</a>,
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football" target="_blank">football</a>,
            and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing" target="_blank">fencing</a>.
            I love coding and learning new stuff about it everyday. I play football passionately and also enjoy fencing, which requires agility and strategy.
            My interests show my balance between sports and learning.
